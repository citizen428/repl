# repl â€”- Add more read-eval-print-love in your life

`repl` is an interactive program which wraps non-interactive programs. Inspired by [Chris Wanstrath](https://github.com/defunkt)'s original [Ruby version](https://github.com/defunkt/repl). It comes with
line editing capabilities (including history and completions) provided by [liner](https://github.com/peterh/liner).

```

## Usage

```
$ repl
Usage:
  repl cmd [options]

Options:
  -compdir string
    	Directory for completion files (default "/Users/<username>/.repl")
  -debug
    	Enable debug output
  -histdir string
    	Directory for history file (default "/Users/<username>")
```

## Completions

Since [liner](https://github.com/peterh/liner) supports completions, `repl` does too. Any file in
the directory specified via the `-compdir` option matching the name of the command you start `repl`
with will be used for completions.

For instance, a file named `~/.repl/redis-cli` containing "get set info" will cause "get", "set", and
"info" to be tab completeable at the `repl redis-cli` prompt.

This is compatible with the original [repl-completion](http://github.com/defunkt/repl-completion)
project, which contains a few common, pre-rolled completion files.
